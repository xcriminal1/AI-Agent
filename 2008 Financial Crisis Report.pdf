#### Causes of the 2008 Financial Crisis

The 2008 financial crisis was a complex event with multiple causes. Some of the main causes include:

- Subprime Mortgage Crisis: The housing market bubble burst, causing a surge in defaults on subprime mortgages, which were then packaged into mortgage-backed securities and sold to investors.
- Deregulation: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 removed certain regulations on financial institutions, allowing them to engage in riskier activities.
- Securitization: The large-scale issuance of mortgage-backed securities made it difficult for investors to assess the risks of these investments.
- Housing Market Bubble: The housing market experienced a bubble, with prices rising rapidly and then suddenly falling.
- Credit Rating Agencies: Credit rating agencies gave high ratings to mortgage-backed securities, making them appear safer than they actually were.

#### Impact of the 2008 Financial Crisis on the Global Economy

The 2008 financial crisis had a significant impact on the global economy, including:

- Global Recession: The crisis led to a global recession, with GDP contraction and high unemployment rates.
- Eurozone Crisis: The crisis exposed weaknesses in the eurozone, leading to a sovereign debt crisis in several European countries.
- Asian Financial Crisis: The crisis led to a banking crisis in several Asian countries, including South Korea and Thailand.
- Global Trade: The crisis led to a decline in global trade, as countries imposed protectionist measures to protect their economies.
- Poverty and Inequality: The crisis exacerbated poverty and inequality, particularly in developing countries.
- Global Growth: The crisis led to a decline in global growth, with many countries experiencing slow growth and high inflation.

#### Conclusion

The 2008 financial crisis was a complex event with far-reaching consequences. Understanding the causes and impacts of the crisis is essential for preventing similar crises in the future.
